            Verification of achievement depends on the quality of data made
            available by the applicant. Metaverse achievement data must be made
            available to Nwankwo Metaverse Records and by providing the
            achievement data during record application, applicants and third
            parties (metaverse creator and or activity overseeing organization)
            are consenting us to use the data on Nwankwo Metaverse Records
            museum subsequently.

          <p style={{ margin: "20px auto" }}>
            For verification purposes, activities in the metaverse leading to
            achievements must be done with the data being captured in real-time
            (archived) and transmitted to an NMR, personal, or recognized third
            partyâ€™s secure cloud storage. And the data reports must be
            accessible on the cloud storage, most preferably as a downloadable
            file. The data must be submitted alongside your record application.

            We advise that you ensure that you or the recognized third party
            body that oversaw the activity in the metaverse must be willing to
            grant NMR access permanently to the data needed for verification and
            other usage, like on the Nwankwo Metaverse Records museum, before
            applying to set or break a record in the metaverse.

            Appraisal must be provided from a recognized metaverse creator or
            organization that oversaw the activity you or your avatar
            participated in the metaverse. In a case where a recognized third
            party is not involved, applicants will need appraisal from 1
            participant (teammate/opponent/listener/spectator) present during
            the activity or record attempt.
          </p>
          <p style={{ margin: "20px auto" }}>
            Appraisal from a recognized metaverse creator or the organization
            that oversaw the metaverse activity you participated in could reduce
            the waiting time on Nwankwo Metaverse Records application decision,
            compared to appraisal from an individual participant.
