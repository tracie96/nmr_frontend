            If you get an Observer for your metaverse record attempt that could
            lead to a metaverse record title, we may be contacting you to
            confirm the state of your record attempt. This will help us know the
            XR hardware (VR for full immersion or the activities brought to our Advisors with AR) needed to ensure the NMR Observer has a hitch free
            process being present for your attempt.
