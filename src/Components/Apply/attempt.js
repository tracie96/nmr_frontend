            Activities done personally or ones that were hosted by other
            organizations or individuals and you (individual or organization)
            participated, could lead to achieving an Nwankwo Metaverse Records
            title.

          <p style={{ margin: "20px auto" }}>
          If you get an Observer for your metaverse record attempt that could lead to a metaverse record title, we may be contacting you to confirm the state of your record attempt. This will help us know the XR hardware (VR for full immersion or the activities brought to our Advisors with AR) needed to ensure the NMR Observer has a hitch free process being present for your attempt.
          </p>
          <p style={{ margin: "20px auto" }}>
          For activities hosted by an organization, there are chances that the organizer might invite Nwankwo Metaverse Records or not. You may need to keep watch on the latest NMR news as we would publish information on activities or events that we are invited to.
          </p>
          <p style={{ margin: "20px auto" }}>
          We advise that it could be best for all participants in a trial to use one brand of hardware, although this is not a criteria considered during record application processing.
